## Fixed Neighbors

"get_csm_for_fixed_environments.py" tells you how to get the continous symmetry measure (cms) 
for a fixed set of neighbors and a fixed coordination environment with ChemEnv. As an example, NaCl is chosen.
Here, the "O:6" environment and its csm is analysed.


## Analysis With Valences

ChemEnv can only analyse coordination environments up to 13 neighbors. Therefore, it is often useful to restrict the analysis to cation-anion bonds only. 
Here, an example is shown where the charges have been used for ChemEnv.
